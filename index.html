        <p>I would see scenes like busy crowds, full shops and reataurants, and street performers.</p>

        <p> I would bring my friends Andrew and Natalie who I met in Rome.</p>
        
        <p>I would see animals like pigeons and well-trained dogs.</p>
        
        <p>I would eat food like pizza and Cacio e Pepe pasta.</p>
